Package cloud provides functions to interact with cloud providers such as
OpenStack and AWS (not yet implemented).

You use it to create cloud resources so that you can spawn servers, then
delete those resources when you're done.

Please note that the methods in this package are NOT safe to be used by more
than 1 process at a time.

It's a pseudo plug-in system in that it is designed so that you can easily add a
go file that implements the methods of the provideri interface, to support a
new cloud provider. On the other hand, there is no dynamic loading of these go
files; they are all imported (they all belong to the cloud package), and the
correct one used at run time. To "register" a new provideri implementation you
must add a case for it to New() and rebuild.
