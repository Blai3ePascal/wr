Package cmd implements wr's command line interface.

It is implemented using cobra, so see github.com/spf13/cobra for details. On top
of cobra we use our own config system; see internal/config.go.

cmd/root.go contains general utility functions for use by any of the sub command
implementations. It also give the help text you see when you run `wr` by itself.

Each wr sub-command (eg. 'add' or 'manager') is implemented in its own .go file.
