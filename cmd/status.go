"vrpipe add" or "vrpipe setup" by running this command.

Specify one of the flags -f, -l  or -i to choose which commands you want the
status of. If none are supplied, it gives you an overview of all your currently
incomplete commands.

The file to provide -f is in the same format as that taken by "vrpipe add"
(though only the first 2 columns are considered).

In -f and -l mode you must provide the cwd the commands were set to run in. You
can do this by using the -c option, or in -f mode your file can contain the
second column holding the cwd, in case it's different for each command. If not
supplied at all, cwd will default to your current directory, but you won't get
any status if you're not in the same directory you were in when you first added
the commands, or if you added them with a different cwd.`,
