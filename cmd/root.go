	Use:   "vrpipe",
	Short: "VRPipe is a software pipeline management system.",
	Long: `VRPipe is a software pipeline management system.

You use it to run the same sequence of commands (a "pipeline") on many different
input files (which comprise a "datasource").

Initially, you start the management system, which maintains a queue of the
commands you want to run:
$ vrpipe manager start

Then you either directly add commands you want to run to the queue:
$ vrpipe add

Or you define a pipeline that works out the commands for you:
Create a pipeline with:                           $ vrpipe create
Define a datasource with:                         $ vrpipe datasource
Set up an instance of pipeline + datasource with: $ vrpipe setup

At this point your commands should be running, and you can monitor their
progress with:
$ vrpipe status

Finally, you can find your output files with:
$ vrpipe outputs`,
