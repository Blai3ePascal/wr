By providing the --memory and --time hints, vrpipe manager can do a better job
of spawning runners to handle these commands. The manager learns how much memory
and time commands in the same requirements_group actually used in the past, and
will use its own values unless you set an override. For this learning to work
well, you should add commands in batches that you think will have similar memory
and time requirements and give them a consistent and meaningful
requirements_group name that you will use again in the future.

For example, if you want to run an executable called "exop", and you know that
the memory and time requirements of exop vary with the size of its input file,
you might batch your commands so that all the input files in one batch have
sizes in a certain range, and then provide a requirements_group that describes
this, eg. "exop.1-2G" for inputs in the 1 to 2 GB range.

(Don't name your requirements_group after the expected requirements themselves,
such as "5GB.1hr", because then the manager can't learn about your commands - it
is only learning about how good your estimates are! The name of your executable
should almost always be part of the requirements_group name.)

The identifier option is an arbitrary name you can give your commands so you can
query their status later. If you split your commands into multiple batches with
different requirements_groups, you can give all the different batches the same
identifier, so you can track them in one go.`,
