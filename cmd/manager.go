The vrpipe manager works in the background, doing all the work of ensuring your
commands get run successfully.

It maintains both a temporary queue of the commands you want to run, and a
permanent history of commands you've run in the past, along with a simple
key/val database that can be used to store result metadata associated with
output files. As commands are added to the queue, it makes sure to spawn
sufficient 'vrpipe runner' agents to get them all run.

You'll need to start this daemon with the 'start' sub-command before you can
achieve anything useful with the other vrpipe commands. If the background
process that is spawned when you run this dies, your pipelines will become
stalled until you run the 'start' sub-command again.`,
