Package schedulers lets the jobqueue server interact with the local job
scheduler (if any) to submit jobqueue clients and have them run on a compute
cluster (or local machine). Examples of job schedulers are things like LSF and
SGE.

It's a psuedo plug-in system in that it is designed so that you can easily add a
go file that implements the methods of the scheduleri interface, to support a
new job scheduler. On the other hand, there is no dynamic loading of these go
files; they are all imported (they all belong to the scheduler package), and the
correct one used at run time. To "register" a new scheduleri implementation you
must add a case for it to New() and rebuild.
